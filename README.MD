#All things Jenkins

This file contains all jenkisn related work I have done in one place. The repo is merely a collection and not in a project by itself

although it could be used as one with discretion.

Things it contains

-- Ansible files for Jenkins installtion

-- Jenkinsfile for creating a NODEjs multistage Jenkins pipeline with stages such as envrionement setup, tests and finally push to docker hub

-- Docker file for Jenkins (which also has docker installed inside it  ;) ) 

-- Jenkins job dsl written in groovy to create freestyle projects in Jenkins. Plan to add job dsl for creating pipelines as well.
